/*** HELP START ***//*

## Description:

The `sas_maxims` macro presents 52 practical and philosophical 
principles aimed at improving SAS programming habits. It can be 
used in training materials, documentation, or as motivational content.
 
Call to the macro displays a collection of 
"*Maxims of Maximally Efficient SAS Programmers*"
using `PROC ODSTEXT` with bold styling for emphasis.
